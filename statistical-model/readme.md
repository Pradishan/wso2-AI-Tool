# Model selection and trainig based on statistical features
As an initial step I just sart with statistical features based AI models
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

before all did a Explotary Data Analysis to underestand the derived Dataset [here](EDA.ipynb).

Then trained the each models under 3 experiment
- Baseline
- SMOTE
- SMOTE+Tomek

in each experiment perfomed the hyperperamter tuing  then get best model preformance from there and perform a comprehensive comparition analysis.
